1. Write a Rust program that prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,`, followed by a new line.

    - Use the function `print!`
    - You are not allowed to use the function `println!`
    - Your program should end in a new line
    - Your program should compile without warnings

3. Write a Rust program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.

    - You should produce the exact same output as in the example
  
      **Example:**
      ```sh
      the1Riddle@linux$ rustc file.rs
      the1Riddle@linux$ ./file
      Size of char: 4 bytes
      Size of i32: 4 bytes
      Size of u32: 4 bytes
      Size of f64: 8 bytes
      ```
